## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why don't I see a version selector?
**A:** The version selector only appears when a region has multiple game versions available. Regions like Kalos (only X/Y) won't show the selector.

### Q: Can I compare maps side-by-side?
**A:** Currently, you can only view one version at a time. Switch between versions using the version selector to compare.

### Q: Why are some maps bigger than others?
**A:** Different regions have different sizes in the actual games. Paldea (Gen IX) is the largest, while early regions like Kanto are smaller.

### Q: Do the maps show exact game geography?
**A:** The maps are stylized interpretations using authentic colors and general layouts. They show the overall region structure and major locations accurately.

### Q: Can I zoom in infinitely?
**A:** Zoom is limited to 4x magnification to maintain map quality. This is sufficient to see all details clearly.

### Q: What if a location isn't marked on the map?
**A:** Some minor locations may not have markers yet. The system is designed to show major routes and areas where Pokémon commonly appear.

### Q: Do DLC maps appear separately?
**A:** Yes! DLC regions like "The Isle of Armor" or "The Teal Mask" appear as separate versions in the selector, as they're separate explorable areas.

### Q: Are event-exclusive locations shown?
**A:** Regular locations are shown. Event-exclusive areas may not appear if they weren't part of the main game geography.

### Q: Can I download maps for offline use?
**A:** Maps are bundled with the app, so they work offline automatically once the app is installed.

### Q: Will more maps be added?
**A:** The system is designed to be extensible. Future Pokémon games can easily be added as new versions.
